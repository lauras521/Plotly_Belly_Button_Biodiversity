# Plotly Belly Button Biodiversity

## Purpose
Roza is a bio researcher in a micro lab.  She is trying to find a solution for Improbable Beef to be able to produce food that tastes like meat but doesn't come from typical meat sources.  She is researching synthesizing meat from bacteria that can be found on the human body to provide a microorganism that can give the perfect taste.  This bacteria is found in the belly button.  Samples have been collected from many nasals and each person as an ID number.  Roza has developed a dashboard so participants in the study can view their results online.  

Below shows 2 views of her dashboard.  The first is for patient ID 940 and the second for ID 959.

## Deliverables 1-3
Roza used the content delivery network for Plotly to be able to create different charts to view the data.  She used JavaScript and HTML along with a CSS stylesheet to be able to complete the project.  

### 1. Horizontal Bar Chart
This chart displays the Top 10 Bacteria cultures found as well as the amount for the selected patient ID.

### 2. Bubble Chart
This chart displays all bacteria cultures found along with the sample value and names for the selected patient ID. 

### 3. Gauge Chart
This chart displays how many nasal scrubs per week were taken from the selected patient ID.

## Deliverable 4
A css stylesheet was used for these 3 customizations:
1. added a picture behind the jumbotron
2. changed the text color within the jumbotron from the default color to white for readability
3. bolded the text in the h5 tag.  This text is Test Subject ID No.:
